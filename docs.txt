So far this seems to be the api that returns all the converstations along with links https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history/test

Postman helped working with the API's. I was able to form the headers for authentication using it

For MailChimp I had to test the api with IE because of Cors: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20035101/why-does-my-javascript-get-a-no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present

Only 'Classic' templates can be edited with the api at MailChimp

So far we are blacklisting:
    twitter
    giphy
    github
