So far this seems to be the api that returns all the converstations along with links https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.history/test

Postman helped working with the API's. I was able to form the headers for authentication using it

Only 'Classic' templates can be edited with the api at MailChimp

So far we are blacklisting:
    twitter
    giphy
    github
